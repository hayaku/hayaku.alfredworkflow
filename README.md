# Hayaku workflow for [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/)

Hi! This is an early alpha of the Hayaku workflow for Alfred 2, if you know what you're doing, you can try it, otherwise â€” wait for the more stable version!

## Install

### Somewhat simple way

1. [Download the latest version of Hayaku](http://hayakubundle.com/downloads/hayaku.alfredworkflow)
2. Install it to Alfred 2 (you'll need the PowerPack for it).
3. Run `InstallHayaku` command in Alfred to install Hayaku and wait a bit for it (we'll add a notification for successful install later).
4. Use it (`h` keyword or `alt+h` on selected text)!

### Somewhat geeky way

Locate where Alfred stores it's workflows, then git clone this repo and init&update all the submodules.

## Update

Running `UpdateHayaku` command in Alfred would update the hayaku workflow for you to the latest version.
