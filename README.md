# Hayaku workflow for [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/)

Hi! This is an early alpha of the Hayaku workflow for Alfred 2, if you know what you're doing, you can try it, otherwise â€” wait for the more stable version!

## Install

Locate where Alfred stores it's workflows, then git clone this repo using this command:

``` sh
git clone git://github.com/hayaku/hayaku.alfredworkflow.git --recursive
```

## Configure

Run `hayakusettings` command from Alfred, or just manually edit `settings.json` at the workflow directory.

See [Hayaku's Readme on settings](https://github.com/hayaku/hayaku#settings-and-preferences).
