# Hayaku workflow for [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/)

Hi! This is an early alpha of the Hayaku workflow for Alfred 2, if you know what you're doing, you can try it, otherwise â€” wait for the more stable version!

## Install

### Somewhat simple way

You can download and install the `hayaku.alfredworkflow` from the [latest release](https://github.com/hayaku/hayaku.alfredworkflow/releases/latest).

### Somewhat geeky way

Locate where Alfred stores it's workflows, then git clone this repo using this command:

``` sh
git clone git://github.com/hayaku/hayaku.alfredworkflow.git --recursive
```

## Update

Running `UpdateHayaku` command in Alfred would update the hayaku workflow for you to the latest version.
